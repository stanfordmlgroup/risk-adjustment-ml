Given demographic and diagnosis information (and optional ZIP code) of a patient, predict prospective annual healthcare spending using a trained LightGBM regression model as described in our paper.

## Usage

### Environment Setup
1. Please install [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) in order to create a Python environment.
2. Clone this repo (from the command-line, `git clone git@github.com:stanfordmlgroup/risk-adjustment-ml.git`.
3. Navigate to the cloned repo: `cd risk-adjustment-ml`.
4. Create the environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
5. Activate the environment: `source activate ra-ml`.

### Preprocessing
We format the data in a CSV with columns: Patient (Integer), Age (Integer), Sex (Char: M/F), 5-digit ZIP code (Integer, optional), as well as a list of ICD-10 Diagnoses (Comma-delimited quote string). An optional "Zipcode" column is needed to run the SDH-based model. Each patient should be placed on their own row. 

The following is a toy example CSV (see [the example](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/risk-adjustment-ml/blob/master/demo.csv)):


| Patient         | Age | Sex | Zipcode | ICD10                 | 
|-----------------|-----|-----|---------|-----------------------| 
| 1               | 46  | M   | 95120   | "F32.0,D64.0,D64.81"  | 
| 2               | 64  | F   | 85001   | "L25.0"               | 
| 3               | 56  | F   | 72201   | "R10.0,R10.30,R53.81" | 
| 4               | 18  | M   | 80201   | ""                    |
| 5               | 50  | F   | 800     | "N15.9,N30.00"        | 


### Inference

The script can be run using Python with the following flags:

`python run.py --csv_path path/to/data --model_path path/to/saved/model --save_path path/to/save/output`

Including `--sdh` will automatically run the SDH-based model. This requires ZIP code data for each patient row. For example, to run the SDH-based model on the demo CSV,

`python run.py --csv_path demo.csv --model_path ml_model_sdh.txt --save_path costs.csv --sdh`
